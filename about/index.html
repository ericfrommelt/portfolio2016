      I spend much of my time obsessing over technology, how it works, and how it affects society. My work grew out of a desire to show how beautiful data, networks, and information could be represented in the abstract. I utilize basic geometry and fundamental design principals to develop complex imagery. There is a human in the machine.

      If you think my work would be appropriate for an upcoming project don’t hesitate to get in touch. I’d love to work with you.
